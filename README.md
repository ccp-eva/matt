## Adding Text

1. Create a new rectangle in Illustrator. Its size defines the bounding box of the text. Give this rectangle a name prefixed with text- (e.g., `text-objectChoiceOne`). Use camelCase, avoid numbers.
2. Add a new key to all translation files within `src/populations/xx-xx/translation.ts`. Use the identical id as defined prior in Illustrator; yet, without the prefix (e.g., `objectChoiceOne`)
3. The text will automatically appear at the defined location.
